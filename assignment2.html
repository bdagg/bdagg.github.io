<p>GreenGeeks is one of the best eco-conscious and eco-friendly options when it comes to Web Hosting. Like scalahosting, the powerful and reliable servers is a large attraction to consumers.</p>

<p>Visit <a href="https://www.hostinger.com/">hostinger.com</a></p>
<p>Hostinger is rated the top web host domain by cybernews.com. Customer service is a top priority for Hostinger and having a free premium domain is what brings in a lot of their users.</p>


<h3>What would I choose?</h3>
<p>I would prefer to use the hostinger domain when deciding to use a webhost. While it is also free, this webhost is very beginner friendly and I would need that as a trait from the site. When researching top options for webhosts, hostinger is rated well if not the best and would be the top choice for me.</p>
