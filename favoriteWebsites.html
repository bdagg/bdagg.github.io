    <li><a href="https://upargos.com/sports/mens-soccer">The <b>Worst</b> Website</a></li>
    <p>This Argos website in my opinion is very ugly. Not just because I have problems with the school itself, but the website really doesn't help its case. Specifically the men's soccer page I have an issue with. The first thing you see is this huge graphic talking about the cascade conference website, that is fine but why does it take up the whole front page? I feel like there could be a rotating bar at the top but why is it the main attention of the website? My other big issue is why are all the tabs at the bottom? I understand you’re trying to be different but I never had a problem with tabs being at the top. I found the tabs hard to find and I don’t like it when I am searching through a website looking for something that should be obvious. This can all be changed with aspects we have learned in class, like sizing and layout.</p>
    <li><a href="https://www.apple.com/">One of my Favorites</a></li>
    <p>This apple website is great as expected in my opinion. They displayed what their brand is on their website very well. When I think of Apple I think of sleek, futuristic, modern, and this is exactly what I see on their website. Just on the first glance of the page we see their most recent product on the market. The way that you can scroll through their selling points on the front page I like a lot as it goes from the Iphone 13, to the macbook pro, into the airpods. I think they do a great job of serving what the apple customer wants to see. The numerous tabs on the top are well placed without taking too much attention away from their products that they are trying to sell on the main page. The colors, font and sizes I thought were greatly placed and displayed the apple brand perfectly.</p>

    <p>The Northface website is very unique like the brand itself. I really love the graphic that starts out on the first page. When the video plays I think that it is perfect for northface and first time consumers alike to look at. The way that we can see the products in nature and then how it comes back the website I think is very unique and something that I haven’t seen before on other websites. I wonder if they took this from their marketing team or created the montage solely for the webpage. This website, like apple is very sleek and visualizes their brand well. Scrolling through gives different looks of what Northface has to offer and the different styles that come with that.</p>
