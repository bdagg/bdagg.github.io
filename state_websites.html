  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://alaska.gov/">Alaska, My <b>Favorite</b> Website</a></li>
    <p>I really like this website because like Alaska, this website is unique. By just looking at it, you can tell that it is prioritizing what makes Alaska special on the front page of the website. I think that the mountain on the front looks sleek and fits the page well.</p>
    <li><a href="https://www.maryland.gov/Pages/default.aspx">Maryland</a></li>
    <p>Maryland also has a great website in my opinion. I really like the lake look that it gives off in the background. The colors come off very well and go with the state flag of Maryland, which I like a lot.</p>
    <li><a href="https://portal.kansas.gov/">Red State, Kansas</a></li>
    <p>This is probably my second favorite website because of the initial look it gives off. The font on the opening search bar along with the mural in the back really draws you in. I give Kansas a lot of credit.</p>
    <li><a href="https://www.maine.gov/portal/index.html">Blue State, Maine</a></li>
    <p>I dont incredibly like this website that Maine is putting out to the public. I don't hate it but I just find it a bit boring. With the capital building in the back and the picture of the Decloration of Independence as well, I find it a bit too historic and not what Maine is today.</p>
    <li><a href="https://portal.arkansas.gov/">Arkansas, My <b>Least</b> Favorite Website</a></li>
    <p>Arkansas is not the greatest website in my opinion. I like the moving pieces in the front page because it gives a interesting look. For me it is just the bland look of the two bars on the top and the complelety white background for the rest. It just looks like a business start up website to me.</p>
